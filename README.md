**Welcome to Purple Gold Mod!** This is a "Vanilla+" style mod, designed to expand the Minecraft experience in a seamless and integrated way, as if it were part of an official update. The adventure begins with the discovery of Aluminum and culminates in the creation of the powerful Purple Gold alloy.

This project was born from a passion for programming and the nostalgia of creating for Minecraft, serving as a learning journey in Java and game development.

## What does this mod add?

The goal is to introduce a new tier of materials and equipment that fits into the game's natural progression, rewarding players who explore and venture out.

### Core Features

* **üíé New Ore: Aluminum Ore!**
    * Found in the middle layers of the world, Aluminum is the foundation for the new technologies in this mod.
    * It can be found in its raw form and smelted to create Aluminum Ingots.

* **üîÆ The Mystic Alloy: Purple Gold!**
    * Purple Gold is not found naturally. It must be crafted through a process that combines resources from the Overworld and the Nether.
    * It is an end-game material, intended for players who have already mastered Minecraft's basic challenges.

* **‚õèÔ∏è Aluminum Tools (Coming Soon!)**
    * A new set of tools positioned between Stone and Iron, offering high speed but with lower durability. Perfect for quick tasks in the early game.

* **üõ°Ô∏è Purple Gold Armor (Coming Soon!)**
    * A direct upgrade to Diamond armor, focusing not only on defense but also on magical bonuses that will reward the high cost of its creation.

* **üé® The Chisel: A Tool for Builders (and OG players)!**
    * An end-game tool that allows you to transform ore blocks (Gold, Iron, Diamond, and Emerald) into their classic texture versions.
    * Perfect for builders and nostalgic players who want to add a special touch to their creations.
    * **Recipe:** It's an expensive tool, requiring Netherite, Blaze Rods, and of course, Purple Gold.

* **üçé The "Old" Enchanted Golden Apple**
    * A new variant of the Enchanted Golden Apple, with powerful effects that bring back to the old days of the game.
